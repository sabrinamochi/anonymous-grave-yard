                John Scott loved going to school. He spent Mondays through Fridays learning how to read, count money and tell time. But it was the creative subjects –– art and music –– that he enjoyed most. John didn’t attend a regular school. In fact, the school he attended didn’t even consider him to be a real student. He was an “inmate,” a “patient” of the Walter E. Fernald Developmental Center, the oldest state-run institution in the United States for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. </br></br>

                John spent his days, and most of his life, in a wheelchair in the institution located in Waltham. He was born with spina bifida, a birth defect that leads to an incomplete closing of the spine and spinal cord. He was paralyzed from the waist down, his legs were atrophied and he had a barrel chest. Born in 1956 in Boston to Eleanor Scott and James Warren Scott, John spent his entire life in the Fernald School. His parents dropped him off at the institution when he was a baby and never came back. </br></br>

                “As far as I know, he had no family involved in his life from the time he was put there. That’s what they did at the time, they basically [put their children] away,” recalls Susan Weiner, 72, John’s teacher between 1970 and 1973, the last years of his life. Nearly 50 years later, Weiner, who retired from teaching in 1973, remembers her favorite student with fondness, his black-rimmed glasses, his black hair and stubble, his love of good conversation and learning. “He was very sweet… he really loved coming to school every day.”</br></br>

                Outside of classes however, John’s experience at the Fernald School wasn’t so positive. He was mostly neglected by nurses and staff who rarely accommodated his paralysis and kept him clean. Due to his disability, a colostomy bag was attached to an opening in his abdomen to collect his waste, but it was seldomly cleaned and changed.</br></br>

                “He needed nursing care, and I truly don’t believe that he got all the care that he needed,” says Weiner from her home in Belmont. “He was never kept clean...he smelled, the bag would smell.”</br></br>

                John died at the age of 17 on April 16, 1973, due to congestive heart failure, a condition in which the heart is unable to pump sufficient blood. As was the case for many patients at the Fernald School, the neglect he experienced in life carried over in death.</br></br>

                Between 1947 and 1979, the Fernald School and the Metropolitan State Hospital, an adjacent mental asylum, were responsible for burying 298 of their patients, including John, in unnamed graves on a plot of former marshland now called the MetFern Cemetery. The grave markers in the cemetery –– which is located a short walk away, through a winding path in the woods, from both institutions –– are sunken and toppled and have only two things etched onto their concrete slabs: “C” or “P” for Catholic and Protestant, and a number that denotes the order in which the patient was buried. </br></br>
            </p>
            <p class="right-col-text" id="demoMap2">
                There are only four patients who were given proper headstones in this space. In these rare cases, family members paid for their loved ones’ full names and birth and death dates to be engraved on a higher-quality stone. However most of these institutions’ patients were either abandoned by their families, were orphans or could not afford a proper burial. </br></br>
            </p>
            <p class="right-col-text" id="demoMap3">
                John is buried under stone C-154. His funeral was a somber affair, attended only by a priest and few staff members, including Weiner. His family was not in attendance. Weiner remembers feeling a profound sense of sadness at seeing John being lowered into his simple grave. “It just seemed kind of barren. There was just something really sad about it, that there wasn’t family... He went into a pauper’s grave.”</br></br>

                This was the reality for hundreds of thousands of others in state-run institutions in Massachusetts. “Most of the state institutional cemeteries in Massachusetts, and really around the country, just have numbers for the folks that are buried in institutional cemeteries,” says Ashlynn Rickord, a historian who has researched Fernald and MetFern and who is currently the cemetery director for Providence, Rhode Island. “MetFern is one of so many that needs to bring names to patients... the state [needs to] take responsibility for these cemeteries.”

                There were at least 16 state hospitals and three state schools in Massachusetts that buried their patients under unnamed graves. A “state hospital” was typically for the mentally ill, and its purpose was to “cure patients” suffering from varying degrees of mental illness and  even diseases such as alcoholism. A “state school” was meant for the disabled, or the “feeble-minded” as they were originally called; they later became known as developmental centers. Their primary purpose was to educate intellectually and developmentally disabled children to be independent. Over time however, conditions deteriorated and these schools transitioned into custodial institutions. </br></br>

                MetFern, a word used to show the combination of MetState and Fernald, is only a small case in a catalogue of larger institutions that adopted similar burial practices. Foxborough State Hospital, Danvers State Hospital and Medfield State Hospital, all named after the towns they’re located in, are a few examples. On average, most institutions buried between 1,000 to 2,000 patients on plots of land out in the woods and in overgrown fields. However, there are some institutions in Massachusetts that far outnumber these figures. </br></br>

                Tewksbury State Hospital, which was and continues to be one of the larger institutions in the state, is one such example. Spanning over 800 acres, the institution first served as an almshouse for the destitute and later transitioned into a custodial facility for the “criminally insane” and a hospital to treat infectious diseases such as syphilis and tuberculosis. Today Tewksbury operates as a hospital providing treatment and care for adults suffering from medical or mental illnesses. Rickord estimates that its cemetery could hold 10,000 to 30,000 patients who were similarly buried without names, birth and death dates – the traditional markings of cemetery gravestones.  Still, these numbers are rough estimations. There is no definitive way to know how many patients are buried in institutional cemeteries, say experts.</br></br>

               “Almost always these [cemeteries] were unnumbered, unnamed and they were often places where both, officially and unofficially, bodies were sold to medical students or stolen,” says Kim Nielsen, a professor of disability studies at the University of Toledo, Ohio. “Medical education tended to include cadavers but people weren’t provided with them, and they tended to be stolen from black cemeteries and insane asylums. These were places where disregarded people were put and nobody seemed to care.” </br></br>

                What these numbers and facts show is how the country collectively perceived people with disabilities. The treatment of the mentally ill and disabled in particular paints a haunting portrait of a country stunted by stigma, one which deemed people with disabilities as shameful, something to hide away and to ignore. </br></br>

                “You could be looking at easily over 100,000 [people buried] in institutional lots [in Massachusetts] that are just marked by a number, or not even marked at all,” says Rickord.

                In response to this, an increasing number of grassroots movements have been spreading across the country, from Utah to Minnesota to Georgia, that aim to bring recognition and justice to those buried under unnamed graves. These movements are focusing on properly marking and preserving the final resting grounds for institutional patients.</br></br>

                Adam Rosenblatt, a professor at Duke University, has been studying this phenomenon for a book he’s writing, due out in late 2021 or early ‘22, on people who care for places of the marginalized dead including mental hospital cemeteries and African American burial grounds. One of his chapters focuses specifically on MetFern and Fernald. </br></br>

               “The movement to try to commemorate mental hospital cemeteries is something that’s been around since the ‘90s, and it seems to be slowly but gradually spreading,” he says from his office in Durham, North Carolina. “There is a desire to contextualize and commemorate…[an] effort to tell the story, whether on the web, even just filling in the gaps on sites like findagrave.com with pictures of each grave, or researching the individual lives so each person is dignified by having their story reported somewhere.”</br></br>

                Alex Green, a local disability historian, heads one of those efforts alongside a group of 11th graders he teaches part-time at Gann Academy, an independent high school tucked between Fernald and MetFern. Using census data and town records, he and the students are reconstructing the lives of the 298 buried in the cemetery. Seventeen-year-old John Scott is one of those. They’re also advocating for better access to medical records and are working on preserving and cleaning up the cemetery to make it a more dignified place. </br></br>

            <h2>The first American institution</h2>
            <p class="content">
                It’s a brisk October afternoon in Waltham. Up ahead, on a hill in the woods where thousands of dry leaves cloak the ground, is an old brick building surrounded by metal fencing. Its windows are broken, its massive wooden door hangs off the hinges and dozens of vines snake their way up its weathered exterior. </br></br>

                The building, which dates back to 1888, is just one of the many structures that make up the campus of the Fernald Center. Green, who often explores the grounds alone and with his students, stands at the door. With a deep breath, he walks into the entrance, ducking beneath rotting wooden panels as he climbs over broken chairs and tables. In the corner, on a pile of dirt and dust, sits an old, crumbling wheelchair. </br></br>
            </p>

                The building is the oldest of the Fernald Center. Since the institution’s closure in 2014 and its subsequent purchase by the City of Waltham, the 196-acre campus has fallen into a precarious state of disrepair and has been completely closed off to the public. Its more than 70 brick buildings have been left to decay and today they only serve as a haunting reminder of those who were forgotten within their walls. </br></br>

               It wasn’t always like this, however. </br></br>

               The institution, originally called the Massachusetts School for Idiotic and Feeble-Minded Youth, was founded in South Boston in 1848 by Samuel Gridley Howe. His vision was to teach people with physical and intellectual disabilities enough basic life lessons so that they could survive independently in society.  </br></br>

               During the mid-19th century, Massachusetts became the seat of the Reform Movement, a major religious revival in which individuals in the state began advocating for public schools, prison reform and mental illness as a call for the betterment of society, says Yoni Kadden, the department chair of history at Gann Academy. </br></br>

                “When [the school] opened it was radical, it was innovative. It must have been mind-blowing to have proposed a place like this,” says Green in his office at Harvard University where he works part time as a fellow teaching op-ed writing. “The concept of people in that era is that people with developmental disabilities could not learn.” </br></br>

                The school moved to a bigger campus in Waltham in 1888 under the direction of Superintendent Walter E. Fernald in efforts to accommodate more patients. This relocation echoed a national trend as institutions across the country began to grow to meet demand.  </br></br>

               “Between 1830 and 1880 the number of institutions in the U.S. just skyrocketed and some of them were very specific in diagnostic terms but others were really broad,” says Nielsen. They kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger. This was part of the effort to contain, isolate, segregate and put away people that were considered undesirable.” </br></br>

               The Fernald School’s move to Waltham also coincided with a time in which institutions began shifting into custodial facilities where people with disabilities could be sent away for life. Due to the stigma surrounding disabilities, these institutions –– which were most often built outside of cities and on the peripheries of communities –– created an opportunity for people to rid themselves of the shame they often felt to have a physically or mentally disabled family member. </br></br>

               “There was a growing movement in the early 20th century where people began to see all sorts of ‘disabilities’ as being detrimental to society as a whole. There was the idea to purify society,” says Kadden.  </br></br>

                That could be stretched to mean anything that embarrassed a family, experts say. “There were people who should not have been in there,” says Glenda Schneider, 70, a physical therapist at Fernald from 1969 to 1972. “People who played chess, read the newspaper. It broke my heart that some of these people were in a state institution for life. I remember the people. I have photographs of them. I remember every single patient I had there.” </br></br>

            <h2>Deteriorating conditions</h2>
            <p class="content">
                As numbers at the Fernald School began to swell into the 20th century, a demand for caregivers intensified, resulting in an increasing number of patients who were neglected. The onset of World War I and then World War II exacerbated conditions when staff members were called away to aid in the war effort. As a result, these institutions hired staff who had little to no experience caring for people with disabilities.  </br></br>

                Then, by the late 1940s and early ‘50s, conditions had severely deteriorated when Quaker Oats, in partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), began conducting a series of radioactive experiments on more than 70 young boys between the ages of 10 and 17. The experiments involved feeding them oatmeal and milk laced with radioactive iron and calcium and directly injecting them with radioactive calcium. The scientists wanted to learn how the body absorbed and processed minerals, according to a 1994 report by President Bill Clinton’s Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments.</br></br>

                These boys were part of the Fernald School’s “science club” and were incentivized with special field trips off campus and gifts such as Red Sox tickets. Clemens E. Benda, Fernald’s clinical director at the time, sent parents a letter in May 1953 explaining the study but never mentioned the radioactive isotopes. Rather, he said they were trying to “improve the nutrition of our children.” He continued: “I hope that you have no objection that your son is voluntarily participating in this study… if you have not expressed any objections, we will assume that your son may participate.”</br></br>
